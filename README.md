# SpotInsights

This is a Flask application that provides insights regarding the user's tracks and artists played on Spotify using their API. Specifically, it does the following:
* Display the top ten (10) tracks, artists, and genres of the user. The time period can be toggled by monthly, semi-annually, and annually.
* Display a bar chart of the artists' popularity score which can be sorted in alphabetically, descending, and ascending order. It also provides the average and range of popularity score and the most and least popular artist from a user's account.
* Provide a radial graph of normalized audio features based on user tracks in terms of monthly, semi-annually, and annually.
* Calculate the correlation among normalized audio features and determine which pairs are positively and negatively correlated.
